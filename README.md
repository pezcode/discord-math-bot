discord-math-bot
================

A [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot for doing math, running on Node.js. It supports anything [math.js](http://mathjs.org/) does, minus a few restrictions.

## Installation

For instructions on how to set up and run the bot, read [SETUP](docs/SETUP.md).

## Usage

I'm running an instance of the bot on a VPS if you want to see it in action:
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=184269837814464512&permissions=3072&scope=bot

It may or may not be online for eternity, so don't get too attached :v
